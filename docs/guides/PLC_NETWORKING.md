# PLC Networking & Remote Access

This guide explains which ports are used and how to enable remote access safely.

## Default ports

- Web UI: **8080** (HTTP)
- Discovery: **mDNS** (UDP 5353)
- Mesh/data: **5200** (TCP/UDP as configured)

## Local‑only by default

trueST ships in local‑only mode by default. To enable remote access:

1. Enable a TCP control endpoint in `runtime.toml`.
2. Set `runtime.control.auth_token` (required for TCP).
3. Use the pairing flow in the Web UI to share access.

## Firewall checklist

- Allow inbound TCP 8080 for Web UI (if remote web access is required).
- Allow UDP 5353 for discovery (LAN only).
- Allow TCP/UDP 5200 if mesh is enabled.

## Recommended remote access options

- VPN (WireGuard or OpenVPN)
- SSH tunnel for Web UI

## Troubleshooting

If remote access fails:
- Check that the PLC is reachable by IP.
- Verify firewall rules.
- Confirm `runtime.control.auth_token` is set for TCP control.
