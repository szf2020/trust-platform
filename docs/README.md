# Documentation Index

This directory contains specifications, guides, and diagrams for truST LSP.

For quick start and runtime inline values, see the root `README.md`.

## Reports

Durable engineering reports and gate baselines are in `docs/reports/`.
See `docs/reports/README.md` for what is kept there vs. what should go to `logs/` or `docs/internal/`.

## Internal Documents

Implementation planning notes and remediation checklists live in `docs/internal/`.

## Guided Examples

Hands-on setup tutorials and example learning tracks are indexed in:
`examples/README.md`.

## HMI Directory Workflow

Production `hmi/` descriptor usage (including process SVG pages and LM tool
invocation order) is documented in:
`docs/guides/HMI_DIRECTORY_WORKFLOW.md`.

## Conformance Suite

Conformance scope, naming rules, and summary-contract artifacts are in
`conformance/README.md`.
External comparison guidance is in `conformance/external-run-guide.md`.

## PLCopen Interop

PLCopen compatibility matrix, migration diagnostics contract, round-trip limits,
and known gaps are documented in:
`docs/guides/PLCOPEN_INTEROP_COMPATIBILITY.md`.

ST-complete import/export walkthrough example:
`examples/plcopen_xml_st_complete/README.md`.

VS Code command workflow for XML import:
`README.md` and `editors/vscode/README.md` (`Structured Text: Import PLCopen XML`).

OpenPLC ST-focused migration guide and end-to-end sample bundle:
- `docs/guides/OPENPLC_INTEROP_V1.md`
- `examples/plcopen_xml_st_complete/README.md` (OpenPLC fixture: `interop/openplc.xml`)

## Vendor Library Compatibility

Vendor library baseline shim coverage and compatibility matrix are documented in:
`docs/guides/VENDOR_LIBRARY_COMPATIBILITY.md`.

## Siemens SCL Compatibility

Siemens SCL v1 supported subset, known deviations, and regression coverage are
documented in:
`docs/guides/SIEMENS_SCL_COMPATIBILITY.md`.

## Mitsubishi GX Works3 Compatibility

Mitsubishi GX Works3 v1 supported subset, known incompatibilities, and
regression coverage are documented in:
`docs/guides/MITSUBISHI_GXWORKS3_COMPATIBILITY.md`.

## EtherCAT Backend v1

EtherCAT backend v1 driver scope, module-chain mapping profile, startup/health
diagnostics, and hardware setup guidance are documented in:
`docs/guides/ETHERCAT_BACKEND_V1.md`.

## Browser Analysis WASM Spike

Worker-based browser static-analysis spike scope, protocol contract, unsupported
features, and go/no-go decision are documented in:
`docs/guides/BROWSER_ANALYSIS_WASM_SPIKE.md`.

Browser host example and build harness:
- `docs/internal/prototypes/browser_analysis_wasm_spike/`
- `scripts/build_browser_analysis_wasm_spike.sh`
- `scripts/check_mp010_browser_analysis.sh`

## Editor Expansion (Neovim + Zed)

Official non-VS-Code LSP setup guides and reference configurations are
documented in:
`docs/guides/EDITOR_SETUP_NEOVIM_ZED.md`.

Reference editor config packs:
- `editors/neovim/`
- `editors/zed/`

## Diagram Maintenance

Use the helper scripts to keep PlantUML diagrams in sync:

- `python scripts/update_syntax_pipeline.py` refreshes
  `docs/diagrams/syntax/syntax-pipeline.puml` and
  `docs/diagrams/generated/syntax-stats.md`.
- `scripts/render_diagrams.sh` renders all `docs/diagrams/*.puml` files to
  `docs/diagrams/generated/*.svg` and updates `docs/diagrams/manifest.json`.

Diagrams are also auto-rendered in CI via `.github/workflows/diagrams.yml`.

## Project Config Example

Use `trust-lsp.toml` at the workspace root to configure indexing and runtime-assisted features.
For inline values you can also set the runtime control endpoint from the VS Code
**Structured Text Runtime** panel (gear icon → Runtime Settings). In **External** mode the panel
connects to that endpoint; in **Local** mode it starts a local runtime for debugging and
inline values.

```toml
[project]
include_paths = ["libs"]
vendor_profile = "codesys"

[runtime]
# Required to surface live inline values from a running runtime/debug session.
control_endpoint = "unix:///tmp/trust-runtime.sock"
# Optional auth token (matches runtime control settings).
control_auth_token = "optional-token"
```

Inline values can surface live locals/globals/retain values when the runtime control endpoint is
reachable and `textDocument/inlineValue` requests include a frame id.

If you set the endpoint from the Runtime panel, inline values work without a manual
`trust-lsp.toml`.
