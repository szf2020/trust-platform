## [Unreleased]

Target release: `v0.9.1`

### Added

- EtherCAT bring-up examples:
  - Added `examples/ethercat_ek1100_elx008_v2/` for EK1100 + EL2008-only hardware chains with a validated 8-output snake pattern.
  - Added helper run scripts and docs for real-NIC bring-up and deterministic mock-mode fallback.
- HMI Phase 0 scaffold start:
  - Added runtime scaffold engine APIs `scaffold_hmi_dir` and `scaffold_hmi_dir_with_sources` in `crates/trust-runtime/src/hmi.rs` to generate deterministic `hmi/` directory artifacts from source metadata.
  - Added `trust-runtime hmi init` CLI workflow (`crates/trust-runtime/src/bin/trust-runtime/hmi.rs`) with style selection (`industrial|classic|mint`) and deterministic generation summary output.
  - Added `trust-lsp.hmiInit` `workspace/executeCommand` support in `crates/trust-lsp/src/handlers/commands.rs`, reusing runtime scaffold generation from workspace sources and returning structured summary payloads.
  - Added VS Code LM tool `trust_hmi_init` in `editors/vscode/src/lm-tools.ts` and `editors/vscode/package.json`, routing HMI scaffold generation through the new LSP command path.
  - Added Phase 0 runtime scaffold tests for external symbol filtering, widget mapping by writability/type, deterministic output stability, and repeated-instance section grouping.
  - Converted `docs/internal/testing/checklists/hmi-complete-implementation-checklist.md` into a tracked execution board with active Phase 0 lanes and work item IDs.
- HMI Phase 1.6 live descriptor refresh:
  - Added runtime descriptor watcher (`notify`) with debounce for `hmi/*.toml` updates and safe hot-reload without runtime restart.
  - Added `schema_revision` to `hmi.schema.get` payloads and wired in-memory revision bumps on successful descriptor reload.
  - Added fail-safe invalid descriptor handling that retains the last known-good schema and prevents runtime crashes on bad TOML edits.
- HMI Phase 2.1 section layout foundation:
  - Added schema-driven section rendering in web HMI (`page.sections`) with responsive 12-column spans for sections/widgets.
  - Added explicit fallback to legacy group card rendering when section metadata is absent, preserving existing trend/alarm/dashboard behavior.
  - Added widget renderers for `gauge`, `sparkline`, `bar`, `tank`, `indicator`, `toggle`, and `slider` with value updates and existing `hmi.write` integration for writable controls.
  - Added transition/micro-animation behavior for gauge/bar/tank/indicator/toggle updates and dark-mode CSS variable overrides via `prefers-color-scheme: dark`.
  - Added integration coverage for section layout assets, renderer assets, and schema span metadata used by the web renderer.
- HMI Phase 2.4 live transport foundation:
  - Added `/ws/hmi` websocket endpoint in the embedded web server for push updates (`hmi.values.delta`, `hmi.schema.revision`, `hmi.alarms.event`).
  - Added web HMI client websocket transport with reconnect/backoff and automatic fallback to HTTP polling when websocket is unavailable.
  - Added schema live-refresh behavior in the web client to re-fetch full `hmi.schema.get` payloads on `schema_revision` events.
  - Added integration coverage for websocket event flow and export transport metadata (`/ws/hmi` route + `config.ws_route`).
  - Added websocket hardening integration gates for local latency SLO budgets (p95/p99), forced socket-failure polling recovery, and reconnect churn stability.
- HMI Phase 2.5 process-page foundation:
  - Added process-page schema support (`kind = "process"`) with page-level SVG asset and bind metadata (`svg`, `bindings`) in runtime HMI contracts.
  - Added secure SVG asset serving route (`/hmi/assets/<svg>`) with path containment checks and SVG-only file restrictions.
  - Added process bind parsing guardrails for safe selector/attribute usage plus optional `format`, `map`, and `scale` transform contracts.
  - Added web client process renderer path to inline SVG assets and apply live bind updates from HMI value streams.
  - Added integration coverage for process schema metadata, asset serving, and negative filtering of unsafe/missing bind selectors.
- HMI Phase 2 completion hardening:
  - Added renderer-state regression coverage for all new widget kinds (`gauge`, `sparkline`, `bar`, `tank`, `indicator`, `toggle`, `slider`) across null/stale/good value paths.
  - Added responsive breakpoint regression checks for desktop/tablet/mobile class behavior in the web HMI layout engine.
  - Added process asset-pack integrity checks for `hmi/pid-symbols/` licensing/library presence, stable IDs in `hmi/plant.svg` and `hmi/plant-minimal.svg`, and selector alignment in `hmi/plant.bindings.example.toml`.
- HMI Phase 3 core command/tool surface:
  - Added LSP command `trust-lsp.hmiBindings` with workspace-root/file scoping and deterministic bindings catalog payloads (`programs`, `globals`) including qualifier/writable metadata and available constraints (`unit`, `min`, `max`, `enum_values`).
  - Added VS Code LM tools `trust_hmi_get_bindings`, `trust_hmi_get_layout`, and `trust_hmi_apply_patch` with dry-run conflict reporting for descriptor file operations.
  - Added VS Code command registrations `trust-lsp.hmi.init` and `trust-lsp.hmi.refreshFromDescriptor` and integrated refresh invocation from HMI patch application flows.
  - Added VS Code HMI integration coverage for LM tool valid/invalid payload handling and cancellation behavior.
- HMI Phase 3.6/3.7 completion:
  - Added LSP diagnostics for `hmi/*.toml` files with stable codes for parse failures, unknown bind paths, type/widget mismatches, and invalid widget property combinations.
  - Added near-match suggestion hints for unknown binding paths in HMI descriptor diagnostics.
  - Added multi-root LM-tool integration coverage to verify explicit `rootPath` resolution and write routing for `trust_hmi_apply_patch`/`trust_hmi_get_layout`.
- HMI Phase 4 panel refresh foundation:
  - Expanded VS Code HMI preview refresh relevance to `hmi/*.toml` and `hmi/*.svg`.
  - Added debounced filesystem watching of HMI descriptor/assets (`**/hmi/*.{toml,svg}`) so open panels refresh on descriptor edits without forced auto-open behavior.
  - Added section-aware panel rendering (`page.sections` + `widget_span`) for dashboard pages.
  - Added process-page panel rendering (`kind = "process"`) with safe binding updates and local `hmi/*.svg` asset hydration in VS Code preview.
- HMI Phase 5 export bundle foundation:
  - Updated `/hmi/export.json` payload contract to `version = 2`.
  - Added `config.descriptor` to export payloads with the resolved live `hmi/` descriptor content when present (or `null` when running legacy/no-descriptor projects).
  - Added export integration coverage for descriptor-backed bundles and renderer-capability assertions in exported `hmi/app.js`.
- HMI Phase 6 intent-to-evidence foundation:
  - Added VS Code LM tool `trust_hmi_plan_intent` to generate/update deterministic `hmi/_intent.toml` artifacts with operator goals, personas, KPI priorities, and constraints.
  - Added VS Code LM tool `trust_hmi_trace_capture` for deterministic scenario-tagged API-level runtime trace capture (`hmi.schema.get`/`hmi.values.get`) into `hmi/_evidence/<run>/trace-<scenario>.json`.
  - Added VS Code LM tool `trust_hmi_generate_candidates` for scaffold-rules-based deterministic candidate generation and ranking by readability/action-latency/alarm-salience metrics with `candidates.json` evidence output.
  - Added VS Code LM tool `trust_hmi_validate` to run machine-readable HMI validation checks, emit deterministic `hmi/_lock.json`, and write evidence runs under `hmi/_evidence/<timestamp>/`.
  - Added VS Code LM tool `trust_hmi_preview_snapshot` to emit deterministic desktop/tablet/mobile snapshot artifacts under `hmi/_evidence/<run>/screenshots/`.
  - Added VS Code LM tool `trust_hmi_run_journey` for API/event-level operator journey execution (no headless browser requirement) with pass/fail timing metrics in `journeys.json`.
  - Added VS Code LM tool `trust_hmi_explain_widget` for widget provenance reporting (canonical ID, symbol/type, write-policy allowlist state, and contract endpoint mapping).
  - Hardened `trust_hmi_run_journey` with tool-side write guardrails (read-only/disabled/allowlist checks) and machine-readable step codes before issuing runtime `hmi.write` requests.
  - Added validation retention support (`prune` + `retain_runs`, default 10) and evidence pruning behavior in `trust_hmi_validate`.
  - Added integration tests covering intent generation, candidate-ranking determinism, trace capture, validation artifact emission, snapshot output, API/event journey execution, unauthorized-write safety handling, evidence retention pruning, lock determinism, and cancellation handling for the full Phase 6 toolset.
  - Added runtime hardening regressions for write-cycle budget checks, websocket slow-consumer/backpressure stability, malformed process-SVG resilience, and rapid descriptor file-churn no-deadlock behavior.
  - Added default gitignore rule for `hmi/_evidence/` artifacts.

  - Added runtime + CLI regression coverage for Siemens SCL bundle generation and `PROGRAM` to `ORGANIZATION_BLOCK` conversion.
- VS Code PLCopen import workflow:
  - Added command `Structured Text: Import PLCopen XML` (`trust-lsp.plcopen.import`) for CLI-backed PLCopen project import from the editor.
  - Command flow prompts for input XML + target project folder, validates conflict paths, runs `trust-runtime plcopen import --json`, and offers quick access to the generated migration report.

### Changed

- Standardized example I/O mapping patterns to use `VAR_CONFIG` bindings (instead of direct `%I/%Q` declarations in `VAR`/`VAR_GLOBAL`) across communication, EtherCAT, Siemens, Mitsubishi, and unit-testing tutorial projects.
- Updated example documentation snippets to reflect `PROGRAM` variables plus `CONFIGURATION`-level `VAR_CONFIG` wiring as the recommended deterministic pattern.
- Browser/WASM position mapping now uses UTF-16 column semantics for protocol compatibility in `trust-wasm-analysis` range/position conversions.
- HMI scaffold update behavior now skips regenerating default `process.toml` when curated custom process pages already exist, and skips creating empty `control.toml` when no writable points are discovered.
- HMI auto-schematic Process scaffold now enforces deterministic grid/anchor rules (shared FIT/PT instrument template geometry, value offset one grid row above sensor centerline, stems snapped to process line, connector-anchored routing) and level-fill bindings now update both `y` and `height` for percent-consistent tank visuals.
- Tutorial `12_hmi_pid_process_dashboard` now uses grid-aligned P&ID SVG layouts (hidden `pid-layout-guides` layer) with compact overview inventory widgets and cleaned page set (no duplicate scaffold `Process` page / empty `Control` page).
- Tutorial `12_hmi_pid_process_dashboard` Process/Bypass P&ID pages now use denser operator layout (integrated status rail, calibrated tank scales, stronger typography hierarchy, and ISA-style symbol/line cleanup) with synchronized level-fill scaling.
- Tutorial `12_hmi_pid_process_dashboard` Process/Bypass P&ID pages now remove duplicated PV summary strip and fix tank header text overlap while keeping tank fill scaling aligned to visible geometry.
- Tutorial `12_hmi_pid_process_dashboard` Process/Bypass P&ID pages now render pipe runs without the extra lane background panel.
- Added grouped communication examples under `examples/communication/` for Modbus/TCP, MQTT, OPC UA, EtherCAT, GPIO, and composed multi-driver setups, and documented protocol transport gates (including `ethercat-wire` unix hardware scope and `opcua-wire` requirement) in examples/tutorial indexes and guide docs (`PLC_IO_BINDING_GUIDE.md`, `PLC_NETWORKING.md`, `PLC_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`).
- Restored the field-tested EtherCAT `EK1100 + EL2008` profile as `examples/communication/ethercat_field_validated_es/` (Spanish operator-focused commissioning walkthrough) so communication examples now include two EtherCAT tracks.
- Added automated runtime CLI regression coverage for grouped communication examples via `crates/trust-runtime/tests/communication_examples_cli.rs`, verifying `build --sources src` and `validate` for `modbus_tcp`, `mqtt`, `opcua`, `ethercat`, `gpio`, and `multi_driver` in CI/test runs.
- Added advanced operations tutorial `23_observability_historian_prometheus` and expanded `16_secure_remote_access` with explicit TLS commissioning/validation steps so observability and remote-hardening flows are covered end-to-end in the examples track.
- CI release-gate aggregation now includes a dedicated `Editor Expansion Smoke` gate for Neovim/Zed integration coverage.
- PLCopen XML Full ST Project Coverage (Deliverable 5):

  - `trust-runtime plcopen export` now emits supported ST `TYPE` declarations and configuration/resource/task/program-instance model back into PLCopen XML.
  - Import/export JSON contracts now include deterministic ST-project coverage counters:
    - `data_type_count`, `configuration_count`, `resource_count`, `task_count`, `program_instance_count` (export)
    - `imported_data_types`, `discovered_configurations`, `imported_configurations`, `imported_resources`, `imported_tasks`, `imported_program_instances` (import/migration)
  - Added CODESYS ST-complete fixture packs (`small`/`medium`/`large`) with deterministic expected migration artifacts and CI schema-drift parity gate in `crates/trust-runtime/tests/plcopen_st_complete_parity.rs`.
  - Updated PLCopen compatibility/spec docs and added end-to-end import/export example project in `examples/plcopen_xml_st_complete/`.
- Project source layout is now `src/` only across runtime/CLI flows:
  - `trust-runtime build`, `test`, `docs`, and `run --project` now require `<project>/src` as the default source root.
  - Legacy `<project>/sources` fallback resolution was removed from bundle/project source lookup.
  - Setup/wizard-generated projects and shipped tutorials/examples now use `src/` consistently.
  - PLCopen import/export project-root resolution now targets `src/` only.
  - `trust-runtime setup` auto-migrates an existing `<project>/sources` folder to `<project>/src` when preparing a project.

- PLCopen ecosystem detection now recognizes OpenPLC markers (`openplc`) for migration reporting/shim selection, with OpenPLC fixture-backed regression coverage.
- PLCopen vendor-library shim matching now also normalizes keyword-style vendor aliases (for example `R_EDGE`) when used in supported type/call positions.
- Migrated `trust-hir` semantic path to Salsa-only backend and upgraded Salsa to `0.26`.
- Enabled VS Code extension integration tests in CI under virtual display (`xvfb`).
- Expanded cancellation checks in workspace-scale LSP operations.
- CI now includes a dedicated conformance gate with repeated-run deterministic comparison.
- VS Code extension marketplace metadata now declares dual-license SPDX (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`) and monorepo repository directory (`editors/vscode`).
- Documentation organization:
  - Public durable reports remain in `docs/reports/`.
  - Working remediation checklists are no longer published in `docs/reports/`.
- `trust-runtime test` output now reports per-test elapsed time and total elapsed time in human output.
- `trust-runtime test --output json` now includes `duration_ms` per test and in summary.
- Tutorial 10/11 docs updated for list/timeout usage and expanded assertion coverage.

### Fixed

- CI Windows build no longer fails on missing `wpcap.lib` when `ethercat-wire` is enabled by default; EtherCAT wire dependency wiring is now unix-target gated while preserving mock-driver support cross-platform.
- MP-001 parity baseline updated for newly added Mitsubishi LSP regression tests so discovery parity gate remains deterministic.
- Parser diagnostics now report a targeted error (`expected identifier after '#'`) for malformed Siemens SCL `#` local-reference syntax instead of generic expression errors.
- Schneider EcoStruxure vendor detection is now distinct from generic CODESYS-family heuristics in PLCopen migration reports.
- GitHub license detection no longer reports an extra `Unknown` license entry after removing the non-standard root `LICENSE` stub (dual-license files remain `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE`).
- Release packaging metadata:
  - VS Code extension package versions are now aligned to the workspace release version to avoid duplicate publish artifacts from prior extension versions.
- Release workflow hardening:
  - VS Code Marketplace publish now runs per-VSIX with retry/backoff on transient network timeouts and treats already-published artifacts as idempotent success for reruns.
- VS Code Marketplace screenshots now use absolute image URLs from GitHub raw content so images render reliably in extension listing pages.
- `trust-runtime validate` no longer reports false `undefined program` errors for valid bundles; it now validates decoded bytecode/module metadata directly and enforces task-program name integrity at bytecode-validation time.
- Bytecode encoding/validation now handles enum-typed constant payloads correctly during module build/validation.
- `%MW` memory marker force/write synchronization in runtime I/O panel flow.
- Debug adapter force latch behavior and state-lock interaction.
- Debug runner now respects configured task interval pacing.
- Windows CI/test path issues (`PathBuf` import and path hygiene guardrails).
- `Harness::run_until` now has a default cycle guard and explicit `run_until_max` limit to prevent hangs.
- Filtered test runs now clearly report when zero tests match but tests were discovered.
- `version-release-guard` now tolerates short ordering races between `main` and tag pushes by polling for the expected version tag before failing.
