## [Unreleased]

Target release: `v0.4.1`

### Added

- Conformance Suite MVP shipped (Deliverable 1):
  - deterministic case pack + versioned expected artifacts in `conformance/cases/` and `conformance/expected/`
  - coverage for timers (TON/TOF/TP), edges, scan-cycle ordering, init/reset, arithmetic corner cases, and mapped memory behavior
  - negative/error-path coverage for runtime overflow behavior and unresolved wildcard mapping compile errors
  - external run guide and submission process (`conformance/external-run-guide.md`, `conformance/submissions.md`)
  - explicit known-gaps register (`conformance/known-gaps.md`)
- `trust-runtime conformance` CLI runner mode:
  - deterministic `case_id` ordering
  - machine-readable JSON summary contract (`trust-conformance-v1`)
  - stable failure reason taxonomy (`conformance/failure-taxonomy.md`)
  - `--update-expected` mode for deterministic artifact refresh
- ST unit-testing tutorials:
  - `examples/tutorials/unit_testing_101/`
  - `examples/tutorials/unit_testing_102/`
- Salsa hardening gates and overnight validation scripts/reports:
  - `scripts/salsa_*_gate.sh`
  - `scripts/salsa_overnight_hardening.sh`
  - `docs/reports/salsa-overnight-hardening-20260209.md`
- Runtime/UI multi-driver coverage and integration tests for Modbus + MQTT.
- New ST assertion functions in runtime/hir:
  - `ASSERT_NOT_EQUAL`
  - `ASSERT_GREATER`
  - `ASSERT_LESS`
  - `ASSERT_GREATER_OR_EQUAL`
  - `ASSERT_LESS_OR_EQUAL`
- `trust-runtime test --list` to discover test names without executing.
- `trust-runtime test --timeout <seconds>` for per-test execution timeout.
- CLI/integration tests for list/filter/timeout behavior and JSON duration fields.

### Changed

- Migrated `trust-hir` semantic path to Salsa-only backend and upgraded Salsa to `0.26`.
- Enabled VS Code extension integration tests in CI under virtual display (`xvfb`).
- Expanded cancellation checks in workspace-scale LSP operations.
- CI now includes a dedicated conformance gate with repeated-run deterministic comparison.
- Documentation organization:
  - Public durable reports remain in `docs/reports/`.
  - Working remediation checklists are no longer published in `docs/reports/`.
- `trust-runtime test` output now reports per-test elapsed time and total elapsed time in human output.
- `trust-runtime test --output json` now includes `duration_ms` per test and in summary.
- Tutorial 10/11 docs updated for list/timeout usage and expanded assertion coverage.

### Fixed

- Release packaging metadata:
  - VS Code extension package versions are now aligned to `0.4.1` to avoid duplicate publish artifacts from prior extension versions.
- `%MW` memory marker force/write synchronization in runtime I/O panel flow.
- Debug adapter force latch behavior and state-lock interaction.
- Debug runner now respects configured task interval pacing.
- Windows CI/test path issues (`PathBuf` import and path hygiene guardrails).
- `Harness::run_until` now has a default cycle guard and explicit `run_until_max` limit to prevent hangs.
- Filtered test runs now clearly report when zero tests match but tests were discovered.
