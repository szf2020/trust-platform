### Changed

- CI release-gate aggregation now includes a dedicated `Editor Expansion Smoke` gate for Neovim/Zed integration coverage.
- PLCopen XML Full ST Project Coverage (Deliverable 5):
  - Profile advanced to `trust-st-complete-v1`.
  - `trust-runtime plcopen import` now supports full ST-project model import for:
    - `types/dataTypes` (`elementary`, `derived`, `array`, `struct`, `enum`, `subrange`)
    - `instances/configurations/resources/tasks/program instances`
  - `trust-runtime plcopen export` now emits supported ST `TYPE` declarations and configuration/resource/task/program-instance model back into PLCopen XML.
  - Import/export JSON contracts now include deterministic ST-project coverage counters:
    - `data_type_count`, `configuration_count`, `resource_count`, `task_count`, `program_instance_count` (export)
    - `imported_data_types`, `discovered_configurations`, `imported_configurations`, `imported_resources`, `imported_tasks`, `imported_program_instances` (import/migration)
  - Added CODESYS ST-complete fixture packs (`small`/`medium`/`large`) with deterministic expected migration artifacts and CI schema-drift parity gate in `crates/trust-runtime/tests/plcopen_st_complete_parity.rs`.
  - Updated PLCopen compatibility/spec docs and added end-to-end import/export example project in `examples/plcopen_xml_st_complete/`.
- `trust-runtime plcopen export` and `trust-runtime plcopen import` now support `--json` for machine-readable report output.
- `trust-runtime plcopen profile` now publishes a compatibility matrix plus round-trip limits/known-gaps contract fields.
- `trust-runtime plcopen import` compatibility scoring now accounts for shimmed vendor-library aliases as partial-coverage items.
- PLCopen ecosystem detection now recognizes Mitsubishi GX Works markers (`mitsubishi-gxworks3`) for migration reporting/shim selection.
- Migrated `trust-hir` semantic path to Salsa-only backend and upgraded Salsa to `0.26`.
- Enabled VS Code extension integration tests in CI under virtual display (`xvfb`).
- Expanded cancellation checks in workspace-scale LSP operations.
- CI now includes a dedicated conformance gate with repeated-run deterministic comparison.
- VS Code extension marketplace metadata now declares dual-license SPDX (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`) and monorepo repository directory (`editors/vscode`).
- Documentation organization:
  - Public durable reports remain in `docs/reports/`.
  - Working remediation checklists are no longer published in `docs/reports/`.
- `trust-runtime test` output now reports per-test elapsed time and total elapsed time in human output.
- `trust-runtime test --output json` now includes `duration_ms` per test and in summary.
- Tutorial 10/11 docs updated for list/timeout usage and expanded assertion coverage.

### Fixed

- Parser diagnostics now report a targeted error (`expected identifier after '#'`) for malformed Siemens SCL `#` local-reference syntax instead of generic expression errors.
- Schneider EcoStruxure vendor detection is now distinct from generic CODESYS-family heuristics in PLCopen migration reports.
- GitHub license detection no longer reports an extra `Unknown` license entry after removing the non-standard root `LICENSE` stub (dual-license files remain `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE`).
- Release packaging metadata:
  - VS Code extension package versions are now aligned to the workspace release version to avoid duplicate publish artifacts from prior extension versions.
- Release workflow hardening:
  - VS Code Marketplace publish now runs per-VSIX with retry/backoff on transient network timeouts and treats already-published artifacts as idempotent success for reruns.
- VS Code Marketplace screenshots now use absolute image URLs from GitHub raw content so images render reliably in extension listing pages.
- `%MW` memory marker force/write synchronization in runtime I/O panel flow.
- Debug adapter force latch behavior and state-lock interaction.
- Debug runner now respects configured task interval pacing.
- Windows CI/test path issues (`PathBuf` import and path hygiene guardrails).
- `Harness::run_until` now has a default cycle guard and explicit `run_until_max` limit to prevent hangs.
- Filtered test runs now clearly report when zero tests match but tests were discovered.
- `version-release-guard` now tolerates short ordering races between `main` and tag pushes by polling for the expected version tag before failing.
