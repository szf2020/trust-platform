truST Platform is an IEC 61131-3 Structured Text tooling suite: a language server, runtime, debugger, and VS Code extension.
The repo is `trust-platform`; shipped binaries keep stable names: `trust-lsp`, `trust-runtime`, `trust-debug`, and `trust-bundle-gen`.

## Components

| Component | Binary | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Language Server | `trust-lsp` | LSP server powering diagnostics, navigation, refactors, and IDE features |
| Runtime | `trust-runtime` | IEC 61131-3 runtime execution engine + bytecode |
| Debug Adapter | `trust-debug` | DAP adapter for breakpoints, stepping, and variables |
| Bundle Tool | `trust-bundle-gen` | Generates STBC bundles for runtime execution |
| VS Code Extension | (bundles `trust-lsp`/`trust-debug`) | Editor UX, commands, and LM tools |

## Quick Start

### Build From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd trust-platform
